Command Reference
=================

The pan distributions provide a set of commands that allow the compiler
to be invoked and that demonstrate how to analyze available logging
information. These commands are provided for ease of use for one-off
tasks. The compiler can be more efficiently invoked via Apache Ant or
Maven for automated use of the compiler in production.
