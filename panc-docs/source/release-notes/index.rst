=============

The pan configuration language allows system administrators to define
machine configurations and to validate them. The pan language compiler
transforms the machine configurations into machine-readable representations
for other tools in the Quattor Toolkit.

This document provides the compiler release notes and change log.  See the
full documentation for information about the pan language and use of the
compiler.
